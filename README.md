# Yelp_Data_Project

This was part of the Kaggle challenge by Yelp - https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset

## Objectives:
The project completes EDA, visualization, ML model, NLP analysis, and a simple recommendation bot based on the dataset provided by Yelp.

## Computation env:
Due to limited computational power and the desire to share our work, we have performed all analyses on a Google Colab machine. 

## Code and Data
You can run our code on Collab here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HLxhqF24weq6gi6cPuggNQeGG4RydfZD?usp=sharing \
Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LlG2EqQ7BstCrH-3HEYApdp-P1XW_CGi?usp=sharing
